My modifications to classicthesis by André Miede

For my thesis, I customized André's ClassicThesis to better match my taste.
These are rather subtle modifications---of course the gorgeous overall look
stays unmodified.

However, since I did these customizations mainly for myself, I relied on a
number of assumptions for my work environment, which might not necessarily 
match yours.

 * Since this was a Diploma thesis, the overall structure better supports such
   smaller theses, as compared to larger PhD dissertations or other books. You
   might need to re-enable some of the stuff I removed, e. g. dedication,
   publications, or the "parts" structure.
   
 * All files are (should be) encoded in UTF-8. If you can, keep it this way.
 
 * I've used pdflatex with the MinionPro package/fonts, together with biber and
   biblatex for the bibliography. I suggest you do the same. I tried to make it
   work with XeLaTeX to allow the use of other fonts, but I failed and
   ultimately gave up. Maybe in this version, ClassicThesis is easier to adapt
   to XeLaTeX.
